# House Marketplace

## Description

Creating this React application was key to understanding the foundations of React.
This project was built so that I would have an additional project to reference when creating future full stack applications.
The House Marketplace app is an app where home buyers can find their next home and sellers to list their home.
Walking through Brad Traversy's explanation was extremely helpful. Understanding React and its components is becoming easier and easier.
